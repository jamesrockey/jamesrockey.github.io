![PIC OF ME]({{ page.image | relative_url }}){:height="45%" width="45%"}

I am currently pursuing my BS/MCS in Computer Science at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My interests lie in the fields of distributed systems, scientific high performance computing, and competitive algorithmic programming.

In addition to using my computer, I am an avid cyclist, bike mechanic, swimmer, and good older brother.
